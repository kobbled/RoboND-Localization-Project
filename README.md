# Where Am I?

In this project, you will learn to utilize ROS packages to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a provided map in the Gazebo and RViz simulation environments.

Over the course of the project, as part of the Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree, you will learn about several aspects of robotics with a focus on ROS, including -

- Building a mobile robot for simulated tasks.

- Creating a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a Gazebo world and utilizes packages like AMCL and the Navigation Stack.

- Exploring, adding, and tuning specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results.

## Installation Instructions

The project can be complete in the provided Workspace in the Classroom. Alternatively, it can be completed on an Ubuntu System with ROS Kinetic installed on it. Some specific ROS packages might be required in order to complete the project -


``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-map-server
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-move-base
$ rospack profile
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-amcl
```


## Run the Project

After completing the project, you can launch it by running the following commands first -

```bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
```

And then run the following in *separate* terminals - Udacity bot:


``` bash
$ roslaunch udacity_bot udacity_world.launch
$ rosrun udacity_bot navigation_goal
```

And then run the following in *separate* terminals - tank bot:


``` bash
$ roslaunch tank_bot tank_world.launch
$ rosrun udacity_bot navigation_goal
```

or for teleop commands run:

```bash
roslaunch tank_bot keyboard_teleop.launch
```
